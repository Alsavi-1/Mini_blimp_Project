Ethan started by going around and asking about the 3 simulation items we have going on since last week:

Coppelia Sim
Working on a better controller, trying to get blimp to turn at the way point. Having trouble with it.
Ethan suggested not trying something harder at this point and focus in a more simple controller.

Controller model 
Ethan mentioned the equations we need for pipeline and state space? 

Webots
Victor is two steps behind the Copelia Sim simulation in webots 

Dr. Perkowski presentation:

Inertia Matrix equations
Moving object Inertia equations 
Euler equations
