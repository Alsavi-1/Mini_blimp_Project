Progress report for the week of 03/27/21-04/02/21.

Victor Albarran 

Last Week:
• Searching for Simulation software, 
o  considering an option that has a free student version and can create robots or where a blimp can be modeled. 
o  reading the documentation for the software and evaluating the best option. 
• Contribute to the Blimp Research Revision Document.
o  writing in the section about software simulation and creating a summary of each of the options considered. 
• Fill the decision Matrix for the software simulation section.

Next Week:
• Continue searching for software simulation. 
o possibly trying the software by building a model and experiment how difficult it is to use.
o Gazebo, Webots, and EZphysics as possible to experiment.
• Continue contributing to document in the software simulation section and help on other sections if needed.
• Upload documentation to wiki (github). 

Issues:
• Personal issues preventing me to produce as much as work as would like.

Nicholas Short

Last Week:
    Met with the team and our industry sponsor for weekly meetings.
    Met with Capstone professor for an alignment meeting.
    Investigated CoppeliaSim as an option for a simulation tool.
        Read through some of the documentation and tutorials to get a handle on its ease of use and capabilities.
        Brief internet research to see if community support is there (i.e. Is CoppeliaSim prolific enough that we can "Google" solutions to problems?)
    Started researching additional options, putting data into a decision matrix.
        Found a Wikipedia entry listing a few dozen simulation programs/environments.
        Visited the websites of several options, reading capabilities and examining samples listed on the website.


Next Week:
    Finalize investigation of simulation software options.
        Will continue to explore the documentation and samples of additional simulation software packages.
        The research from this investigation will be used in determining the simulation software that is the best fit for our use case.
    Assist in continuing to generate the document detailing design space, simulation options/decision, and testing metrics.
    Meet with the team and our industry sponsor for weekly meetings.
    Begin fleshing out a model of a blimp in the simulation software of choice.
        Jacob has a simplified 3D model of a blimp that should be importable to whichever simulation environment we decide on.
        Initial work should be in defining (either through code, or a GUI environment) as many of the design space parameters as we need to produce a 
        blimp that has basic movement capabilities (movement in the forward direction, for example).


Issues:

    Constant flow of family, including niece and nephews, throughout the weekend (for the holiday), 
    as well as my own kids, made it difficult to work efficiently.

Zeming Zhou 

Last week, 
I revised our document. 
I attended the group meeting on Monday. 
I met with our sponsor on Thursday. 
I attended the graduation design meeting on Friday.

Next week,
Participate in group meetings, 
Continue to modify the information that needs to be improved, 
Prepare for meetings with sponsors, 
Refer to more blimp design reports to learn more about airship design.

Issues:
I have a TOEFL test this week and I have to work hard to review it!

Benjamin Vu

Last Week:
    Met with the team and our industry sponsor for weekly meetings
    Alignment meeting with Capstone professor
    Assign teammates tasks to work on 
    Started a new doc to incorporate what was discussed from the meeting
    New Document formatting

Next Week:
    Check up with teammates on task 
    Work on 'Generic complications' with Dylan
    Read: AA 449 Final Milestone Report Blimp Project
    Review Metrics section for continuity
    Assist as needed from team

Issues:
    Caretaking my Grandma causes inconsistent time use, which affects the time I would like spend on the project
