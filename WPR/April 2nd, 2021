Week of 03/27/21-04/02/21

Last Week:
• Searching for Simulation software, 
o  considering an option that has a free student version and can create robots or where a blimp can be modeled. 
o  reading the documentation for the software and evaluating the best option. 
• Contribute to the Blimp Research Revision Document.
o  writing in the section about software simulation and creating a summary of each of the options considered. 
• Fill the decision Matrix for the software simulation section.

Next Week:
• Continue searching for software simulation. 
o possibly trying the software by building a model and experiment how difficult it is to use.
o Gazebo, Webots, and EZphysics as possible to experiment.
• Continue contributing to document in the software simulation section and help on other sections if needed.
• Upload documentation to wiki (github). 

Issues:
• Personal issues preventing me to produce as much as work as would like.
