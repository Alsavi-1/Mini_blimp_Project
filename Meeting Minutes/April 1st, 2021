What has been done so far
Made progress on Research / bibliography 
Mark Faust got the team on the same page on what should be done on the doc.

Galois 
Doesnâ€™t recommend a GUI to make blimp models 
Unless the tool/software we look into has it included 
A manual config file to change value of blimp model should serve the same purpose
Doc / Bibliography is more what they expected
