MEETING NOTES
Next steps
Enable measurement of metrics mentioned in paper
Using different airframes and compare within simulation
Model of airframe created using techniques mentioned (dev process)
Start building model which was designed and simulated

Model NEEDs to have prototypical merit.  All features must be justified.

Faust not seeing reflection of specific dials/switches. Need to be able to grab metrics identified in paper.
What’ smissing is identifying…? Need to be able to change design features somehow. Possibly gui, minimum backend. 
Want to be able to sit down with paper and simulate different models
Could be useful to make obviously bad design. Either to show problems with sim or to show that intuition is wrong. Could also demonstrate why model is bad.

Want to be able to compare webots and copelliasim. Optional but useful.

Marknotes
While fresh in mind
Make revised plan which lets us leave meeting with idea of tasks for next 3 or 4 weeks
For nick make component switches

Near term goals
See equivalent sim with webots
See metrics from copelliasim
Modify stuff

Blimp components chapter
